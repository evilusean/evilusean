### Junior(Mid) Full Stack Web Developer 
Full-stack web developer, data analyst, and IT specialist with a passion for building things that work (and sometimes look good). </br>
If I can't figure it out(unlikely). I will ask AI, Stack OverFlow, then the documentation, then the senior dev, in that order. </br>
I'm a jack-of-all-trades, master of some, and always eager to learn more. I know with my tech stack, I've spread myself thin, pay me and you can choose my specializeASean. What's my best programming language? The one you pay me to know. </br>
